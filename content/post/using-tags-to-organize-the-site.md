Tags are tiny bits of information to organize your content and make it easier to find for users. If tags are not used correctly they can create confusion and chaos instead of order.  Tags can quickly get out of hand if you don't have a plan from the beginning.

Before you start tagging posts think about the topics you will be writing about most often. Imagine you have 50-500 posts. How many tags will you need to organize these posts? 10-20 tags is probably enough. If you have 100 posts and 50 tags you will probably end up with quite a few tags that only have a single post, this defeats the purpose of tags.

Keep your tags high-level. Use Amazon's menu as an example. They sell approximately 146 gazillion products yet their main product drop-down menu is only about 25 long. They are using broad categories to organize information. If Amazon can narrow it down to 20 surely a smaller site can manage too.
