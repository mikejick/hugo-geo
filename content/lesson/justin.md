Justin Rose has emerged as a fantastic host at this week's British Masters, but on Friday he displayed the talent that has him closing in on the World No. 1 ranking again. During the second round of the European Tour event, Rose found himself way back on Walton Heath's par-5 sixth hole after two shots, but he delivered a dreamy driver-off-the-deck to set up an easy birdie.

More incredible, though, is that Rose's splendid play isn't even the best driver-off-the-deck shot on that hole this week. On Thursday, Andy Sullivan let the Big Dog eat from the fairway and came within inches of an albatross!
